### How To Run:
#### Set up the server
- In the terminal, cd into the "convo_server" folder. Enter the command "npm start". Server should indicate it is now running.

#### Set up the client
- In another terminal, cd into the "convo_client" folder. Enter the command "npm start". The localhost:3000 page should start up. You can now login multiple users into the same convo through different tabs.
