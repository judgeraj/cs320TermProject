# cs320TermProject
Social Media Website
Thanks for Visiting our Teams GitHub page.

Members: Team members: Vivian, Rajpreet, Emily, Robert, Kevin

Overview: Our project idea is to create a website with various social media features. Each member will focus on implementing one of these features. This may include: a user status feature, a chatbox/messaging system, a gps/location tracker for events, a built-in mini game, a tailored newsfeed, and an interest matchmaker feature.

Vivian: For my cool cam, I wanted to add a feature to the website where people could match shows that they are interested in watching with any other user. For example, each user could select movies that they want to see from a catalogue and the user could select another user to compare movies with and it will show what movies both users selected. This could make choosing a movie to watch together easier. An addition to this is possibly pulling catalogues from different streaming platforms so the user can toggle which catalogues they want shown depending on what streaming services they are subscribed to.

Raj: For my cool cam, I will be planning on implementing a in-browser minigame or possibly multiple dependent on time and as well as a tailored newsfeed for each users preferences. For the minigames the style of games as of now are turn based type games however we are open to changes. The newsfeed will be finding each users desired news (Politics, weather, local reports, etc) and displaying articles in a well organized fashion.

Emily: For my cool cam, Iâ€™m thinking about creating a chatbox/messaging feature for the website. This would allow users of the website to communicate with each other. I would like to try implementing private conversations between two users and public/private group chats between multiple people.

Robert: For my cool cam, I will be creating location-based features for our social media website. As of now, I am thinking of location-sharing like tracking friends or family, or assisted navigation services. Depending on the difficulty of its implementation, changes will be considered.

Kevin: For my cool cam, I am implementing a online/offline user status feature. The program will detect mouse movements or interactions with the website to determine status. More things will probably be added to this in the future depending on the difficulty.

All ideas are subject to change.
